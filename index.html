      <h3>Tree Pruning</h3>
      <p>Tree pruning refers to the maintenance of the aesthetic appeal of a tree. Pruning could be done in different ways such as taking out ugly branches, thinning the crown, crown reduction, removing lower branches, and shaping the tree for design purposes. To maintain the visual artistry of the tree, diseased or damaged branches must be taken out. A lower branch that may cause obstruction also needs to be pruned. The unwanted branches must be pruned in a manner that the stem or the trunk is protected. To protect the stem as well as the other branches, all pruning cuts should be done on the branch side of the stem collar. Doing so also allows the tree to heal faster after pruning. Thinning the crown refers to reducing the density of the branches to allow new branches to grow and permit better air circulation. Crown reduction refers to the method used to reduce the height of the tree by reducing the canopy. Tree pruning must be done during the dormant period as it lessens the risk of fungus infection or insect infestation. Pruning actually protects the tree against fungus because of proper air circulation. Pruning the tree on a regular basis minimizes the risks on properties that may be caused by falling tree branches.</p>
      <h3>Tree Removal</h3>
      <p>Despite the myriad of benefits a tree can give to mankind, there will always come a time when it becomes a liability and needs to be removed. Tree removal may be considered if certain trees are no longer nice to look at, crowding a property, dying or posing a hazard to people or property and already needs to be cut down and removed. However, prior to tree removal, a professional tree worker or an arborist needs to assess the tree if it needs to be removed or just pruned. If the risk assessment unveils potential issues, like if the tree is already dying and there’s no way of recuperating, then tree removal may be the only solution to the problem. The process of removing a tree may vary depending on the size of the tree and its surroundings. Important factors must be considered before the tree removal procedure such as: are there utility wires within the vicinity? Will removing the tree affect nearby structures, other trees, or buildings? Removing a tree near a city park or a residential area may require a simple procedure but those near commercial areas and buildings may call for complicated procedures to get the job done efficiently.

      <h3>Stump Grinding</h3>
      <p>​Stump grinding is the method applied when removing tree stumps with a stump cutter that uses rotating cutting blades to chip away wood. It is usually done to maintain the artistic value of a landscape. Stump grinding only removes the stump above the ground leaving the lower grade stump and the roots to decompose below the surface. Stump grinding is considered the best solution to remove tree stumps especially those in the lawn areas. While the process is expected to produce a considerable amount of mulch and soil, no worries as these byproducts of stump grinding can be utilized to backfill the hole or left on site to settle over time.</p>
